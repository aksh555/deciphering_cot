In Rot-12, each letter in the original text is shifted 12 positions forward in the alphabet to produce the encoded text. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, we use modulo 26 arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet when necessary.\n\nTo decode, we shift each letter in the encoded text backward by 12 positions. Here's how it works for each letter in \"otaaeqp\":\n\n1. **o** (encoded, position 14):\n   - Original position: (14 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 28 mod 26 = **2**\n   - Original letter: Position 2 \u2192 **C**\n\n2. **t** (encoded, position 19):\n   - Original position: (19 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 33 mod 26 = **7**\n   - Original letter: Position 7 \u2192 **H**\n\n3. **a** (encoded, position 0):\n   - Original position: (0 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 14 mod 26 = **14**\n   - Original letter: Position 14 \u2192 **O**\n\n4. **a** (encoded, position 0):\n   - Same as above \u2192 **O**\n\n5. **e** (encoded, position 4):\n   - Original position: (4 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 18 mod 26 = **18**\n   - Original letter: Position 18 \u2192 **S**\n\n6. **q** (encoded, position 16):\n   - Original position: (16 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 30 mod 26 = **4**\n   - Original letter: Position 4 \u2192 **E**\n\n7. **p** (encoded, position 15):\n   - Original position: (15 - 12 + 26) mod 26 = 29 mod 26 = **3**\n   - Original letter: Position 3 \u2192 **D**\n\nPutting it all together, we get the decoded message:\n\n**C H O O S E D**\n\nAlthough \"CHO OSED\" seems like it could be the word \"CHOSED,\" that isn't a valid English word.

Here's how it's done:\n\n1. Assign numerical positions to each letter (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).\n\n2. For each letter in the ciphertext, subtract 12 and adjust for wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.\n\n3. Convert the numerical positions back to letters.\n\nLet's apply this to \"dafgzpm\":\n\n| Cipher Letter | Position | Position - 12 | Adjusted Position | Plain Letter |\n|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| d             | 4        | 4 - 12 = -8   | -8 + 26 = 18      | R            |\n| a             | 1        | 1 - 12 = -11  | -11 + 26 = 15     | O            |\n| f             | 6        | 6 - 12 = -6   | -6 + 26 = 20      | T            |\n| g             | 7        | 7 - 12 = -5   | -5 + 26 = 21      | U            |\n| z             | 26       | 26 - 12 = 14  | 14                | N            |\n| p             | 16       | 16 - 12 = 4   | 4                 | D            |\n| m             | 13       | 13 - 12 = 1   | 1                 | A            |\n\nPutting these letters together, we get the original text:\n\n**Original text: rotunda**", "To decode the Rot-12 text \"zafotqp\", we will shift each letter back by 12 positions in the alphabet.\n\nFirst, assign numbers to each letter (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25):\n\n- z (25): (25 - 12) % 26 = 13 \u2192 n\n- a (0): (0 - 12) % 26 = 14 \u2192 o\n- f (5): (5 - 12) % 26 = 19 \u2192 t\n- o (14): (14 - 12) % 26 = 2 \u2192 c\n- t (19): (19 - 12) % 26 = 7 \u2192 h\n- q (16): (16 - 12) % 26 = 4 \u2192 e\n- p (15): (15 - 12) % 26 = 3 \u2192 d\n\nCombining these letters, we get the original text:\n\n**notched**"], "accs": [false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false, true, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, true, false, true, false, true, true, true, true, true], "acc": 0.78, "eds": [1679, 1803, 1334, 907, 1639, 677, 957, 855, 1034, 986, 854, 1437, 1634, 623, 989, 1753, 695, 1117, 883, 1119, 1363, 923, 1152, 1738, 722, 1152, 811, 712, 649, 1070, 858, 1040, 927, 400, 1483, 732, 797, 834, 734, 828, 788, 891, 1653, 1818, 724, 901, 746, 1011, 1224, 450], "ed": 1042.12, "mean_completion_tokens": 1832.96}
