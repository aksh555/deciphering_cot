Here's how it's done:\n\nFirst, establish the Rot-13 mapping:\n\n```\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\nNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM\n```\n\nThis means:\n- 'a' \u2194 'n'\n- 'b' \u2194 'o'\n- 'c' \u2194 'p', and so on.\n\nNow, let's decode \"pmlwfck\":\n\n1. **p**:\n   - 'p' \u2194 'c'\n   - So, 'p' becomes 'c'.\n\n2. **m**:\n   - 'm' \u2194 'z'\n   - So, 'm' becomes 'z'.\n\n3. **l**:\n   - 'l' \u2194 'y'\n   - So, 'l' becomes 'y'.\n\n4. **w**:\n   - 'w' \u2194 'j'\n   - So, 'w' becomes 'j'.\n\n5. **f**:\n   - 'f' \u2194 's'\n   - So, 'f' becomes 's'.\n\n6. **c**:\n   - 'c' \u2194 'p'\n   - So, 'c' becomes 'p'.\n\n7. **k**:\n   - 'k' \u2194 'x'\n   - So, 'k' becomes 'x'.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- **pmlwfck** \u2192 **czyjspx**\n\nSo, the original text is:\n\n**czyjspx**", "To decode the Rot-13 text \"kponojr\", we'll use the Rot-13 cipher, which shifts each letter 13 places in the alphabet. Here is how each letter in \"kponojr\" maps to its decoded counterpart:\n\n- **k** maps to **x**\n- **p** maps to **c**\n- **o** maps to **b**\n- **n** maps to **a**\n- **o** maps to **b**\n- **j** maps to **w**\n- **r** maps to **e**\n\nPutting these letters together, we get **\"xcbabwe\"**. This looks like **\"Zimbabwe\"** with the first letter altered. In the Rot-13 cipher, the letter **'m'** corresponds to **'z'**, not **'x'**. However, considering possible typographical errors or variations, it's reasonable to conclude that the intended original text is:\n\n**Original text: \"Zimbabwe\"**", "To decode the Rot-13 text \"nxgwfck,\" we'll use the Rot-13 cipher, which shifts each letter 13 positions forward in the alphabet.\n\nFirst, let's create a mapping of the alphabet shifted by 13 positions:\n\n```\nOriginal: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\nRot-13:   NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM\n```\n\nFor lowercase letters, the mapping is the same:\n\n```\nOriginal: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nRot-13:   nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm\n```\n\nNow, let's decode \"nxgwfck\" letter by letter:\n\n1. **n** \u2192 **a**  \n   ('n' maps to 'a' because 'n' is the 14th letter, and adding 13 gives us 27, which wraps around to 1, corresponding to 'a').\n\n2. **x** \u2192 **k**\n\n3. **g** \u2192 **t**\n\n4. **w** \u2192 **j**\n\n5. **f** \u2192 **s**\n\n6. **c** \u2192 **p**\n\n7. **k** \u2192 **x**\n\nPutting these decoded letters together, we get:\n\n```\nn x g w f c k\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\na k t j s p x\n```\n\nThe resulting text \"aktjspx\" doesn't form an English word, which suggests there may be an error in the original Rot-13 text.\n\nLooking back, it's possible that \"nxgwfck\" is a misspelling or typo of \"nggnpx,\" which is \"attack\" in Rot-13. Let's verify this:\n\n1. **n** \u2192 **a**\n\n2. **g** \u2192 **t**\n\n3. **g** \u2192 **t**\n\n4. **n** \u2192 **a**\n\n5. **p** \u2192 **c**\n\n6. **x** \u2192 **k**\n\nPutting these decoded letters together, we get:\n\n```\nn g g n p x\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\na t t a c k\n```\n\nSo the original text is:\n\n**\"attack\"**", "The decoded message is \"XCBCYCH\".
