When shifting 17 positions forward, some letters might wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. To decode the message correctly, I will try again, taking into account the wrapping around:\n\nx -> i ( correct)\nj -> e ( correct)\nk -> f ( correct)\nz -> k ( incorrect, z is the 26th letter, so shifting 17 positions backward would be", "\n\nTo decode the message, I will shift each letter 17 positions backward in the alphabet.\n\nHere is the decoded message:\n\nl -> e\nk -> d\nw -> t\nv -> s\nj -> c\nk -> d\ni -> h\n\nThe decoded message is: \"edtsdch\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to form a coherent phrase.
