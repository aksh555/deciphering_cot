So, we count 6 letters backward from d: c, b, a, z, y, x. \n   Therefore, d -> x is not correct either. We need to count the letters correctly. \n   d is the 4th letter. We need to shift 6 positions backward. We count the letters as follows: d (4th), c (3rd), b (2nd", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 6 positions backward:\n1. u -> o\n2. v -> s\n3. o -> i\n4. p -> j\n5. y -> s\n6. v -> s\n7. d -> x\n\nOriginal text: osijssx", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 6 positions backward:\n1. d -> Y (since d is the 4th letter, and 4 - 6 = -2, we go back 2 letters from the start of the alphabet, which wraps around to the end, so we get Y, the 25th letter, but since we only went back 2 letters, we get the 25th letter, then go back 4 more to get to the 21st letter, then go back 2 more to get to the 19th letter, then go back 2 more to get to the 17th letter, then go back 1 more to get to the 16th letter, then go back 1 more to get to the 15th letter, then go back 1 more to get to the 14th letter, then go back 1 more to get to the 13th letter, then go back 1 more", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 6 positions backward:\n\n1. d -> Y (since d is the 4th letter, and 4 - 6 = -2, we wrap around to the end of the alphabet, so Y is the correct decoding)\n   No, that's incorrect. Since d is the 4th letter, we shift 6 positions backward from d, which would be the 4 - 6 = -2 letter. However, since we can't have a negative letter, we add 26 to -2 to get 24. The 24th letter is X, then the 25th is Y, the 26th is Z, the 1st is A, the 2nd is B, the 3rd is C, the 4th is D. Six positions before D is the 24th letter minus 2 more, or the 22nd letter.
