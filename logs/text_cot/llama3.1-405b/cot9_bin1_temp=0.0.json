of the alphabet, e shifted 9 positions backward becomes n doesn't make sense. Let's correct that: e -> n is incorrect. Since e is the 5th letter, shifting 9 positions backward would be: e -> (5 - 9) which is not correct. We need to wrap around the alphabet: e is the 5th letter, so we count back 9 from e: e, d, c, b, a, z, y, x, w. So, e -> w doesn't make sense either. Let's recount: e is the 5th letter. We need to go back 9 steps from e.", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. t -> o\n2. r -> i\n3. w -> r\n4. o -> i\n5. x -> q\n6. u -> b\n7. t -> o\n\nOriginal text: \"oriqibo\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. r -> i\n2. w -> r\n3. m -> d\n4. r -> i\n5. j -> a\n6. w -> r\n7. j -> a\n\nOriginal text: \"Iridira\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. l -> c\n2. j -> a\n3. a -> l\n4. r -> i\n5. c -> t\n6. j -> a\n7. b -> s\n\nOriginal text: \"calitas\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. b -> s\n2. r -> i\n3. u -> l\n4. e -> x\n5. n -> g\n6. a -> r\n7. h -> y\n\nOriginal text: Silxgry", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. r -> i\n2. w -> r\n3. t -> o\n4. u -> l\n5. r -> i\n6. w -> r\n7. p -> o\n\nOriginal text: \"iroliro\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. j -> a\n2. k -> b\n3. b -> s\n4. n -> e\n5. w -> r\n6. b -> s\n7. n -> e\n\nOriginal text: \"abserse\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. u -> l\n2. j -> a\n3. e -> x\n4. j -> a\n5. k -> b\n6. r -> i\n7. c -> n\n\nOriginal text: \"labaxbin\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. x -> q\n2. d -> o\n3. c -> t\n4. b -> s\n5. r -> i\n6. i -> h\n7. n -> g\n\nOriginal text: \"qotshig\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. a -> l\n2. n -> e\n3. f -> q\n4. r -> i\n5. a -> l\n6. n -> e\n7. m -> d\n\nOriginal text: \"leqiled\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. j -> a\n2. k -> b\n3. b -> s\n4. j -> a\n5. u -> l\n6. x -> q\n7. v -> o\n\nOriginal text: \"absalqo\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. p -> i\n2. n -> k\n3. c -> t\n4. k -> r\n5. j -> a\n6. l -> e\n7. t -> q\n\nOriginal text: \"iktraeq\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. j -> a\n2. l -> c\n3. l -> c\n4. d -> o\n5. b -> s\n6. n -> e\n7. a -> l\n\nOriginal text: \"acco sel\"", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 9 positions backward:\n\n1. b -> s\n2. c -> t\n3. a -> l\n4. r -> i\n5. e -> x\n6. n -> g\n7. w -> r\n\nOriginal text: Stlixir"], "accs": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "acc": 0.01, "eds": [157, 156, 158, 158, 157, 156, 158, 157, 156, 158, 160, 156, 155, 159, 156, 157, 158, 157, 155, 157, 157, 159, 156, 157, 157, 157, 158, 156, 158, 158, 155, 158, 158, 158, 158, 159, 156, 155, 157, 155, 159, 156, 157, 158, 155, 158, 159, 157, 156, 158, 156, 156, 158, 158, 157, 159, 159, 158, 156, 156, 158, 157, 156, 157, 156, 154, 154, 157, 159, 158, 156, 158, 157, 156, 155, 157, 157, 159, 156, 159, 155, 159, 159, 158, 158, 157, 688, 160, 157, 157, 156, 158, 157, 159, 159, 158, 158, 157, 159, 156], "ed": 162.5}
