positions backward: v -> u doesn't work, so we go to the end of the alphabet and count back: u -> F (since u is the 21st letter, we go to the 6th letter, F, but we have to go to the end and count back, so we go from u to F, but we go from u to the end, which is 6 letters, and then we go back 15 letters, so we go from z to F, but we go from z to u, and then we go back 6 letters, so we go from u to F, but we go from u to z, and then we go back 21 letters, so we go from z to F, but we go from z to u, and then we go back 6 letters, so we go", "\n\nTo decode the message, we shift each letter 21
